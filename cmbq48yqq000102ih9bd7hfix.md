### ‚öôÔ∏è What You'll Learn:

* Creating a Python menu-based app
    
* Working with lists
    
* Saving data to a file
    
* Reading and updating tasks
    

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:

* Python 3.x
    
* Any code editor (I used VS Code)
    
* Terminal / Command Prompt
    

---

### üß© Step-by-Step Code Explanation:

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Create the Main Menu

```plaintext
pythonCopyEditdef display_menu():
    print("\n--- To-Do List ---")
    print("1. View Tasks")
    print("2. Add Task")
    print("3. Remove Task")
    print("4. Exit")
```

#### üìù Step 2: Add & View Tasks

```plaintext
pythonCopyEdittasks = []

def add_task():
    task = input("Enter your task: ")
    tasks.append(task)
    print(f"Task '{task}' added!")

def view_tasks():
    if not tasks:
        print("No tasks added yet.")
    else:
        print("\nYour Tasks:")
        for idx, task in enumerate(tasks, 1):
            print(f"{idx}. {task}")
```

#### ‚ùå Step 3: Remove a Task

```plaintext
pythonCopyEditdef remove_task():
    view_tasks()
    try:
        task_num = int(input("Enter task number to remove: "))
        if 1 <= task_num <= len(tasks):
            removed = tasks.pop(task_num - 1)
            print(f"Removed: {removed}")
        else:
            print("Invalid task number.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number.")
```

#### üîÅ Step 4: Run the App

```plaintext
pythonCopyEditwhile True:
    display_menu()
    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")
    
    if choice == "1":
        view_tasks()
    elif choice == "2":
        add_task()
    elif choice == "3":
        remove_task()
    elif choice == "4":
        print("Exiting... Bye!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Try again.")
```

### üí° What I Learned:

* How to use functions to organize code
    
* How to work with lists and user input
    
* How loops and conditions help control program flow
    

---

### üîö Conclusion:

This was a fun and useful beginner project. If you're learning Python, try this out‚Äîit only takes 15‚Äì20 minutes, and you‚Äôll understand so many key concepts in one go.

---

### üîÅ What‚Äôs Next?

I plan to upgrade this app by:

* Saving tasks to a file so they don't disappear
    
* Adding due dates or priorities
    
* Making a GUI using **Tkinter** or **PyQt**
